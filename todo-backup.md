## Critical Issues to Fix

### TypeScript Errors
1. **trust-credibility.tsx** - Missing UI component imports (card, badge, button)
2. **enhanced-auth.tsx** - Undefined 'user' variable and MFA type issues
3. **mfa-settings.tsx** - Missing AuthContext properties and type mismatches
4. **UserMenu.tsx** - Missing 'supabaseUser' property

### Next Steps
1. Fix all TypeScript errors
2. Ensure UI components are properly imported
3. Update AuthContext types to match usage
4. Test authentication flow
5. Resume AI dashboard implementation
