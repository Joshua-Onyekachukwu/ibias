Hi {{contact.first_name}},

**87% of SMBs are drowning in data but starving for insights.**

#### **Version C: Story-Driven Approach**

**Subject:** `Live prototype: AI that turns data into $10M+ decisions`

Hi {{contact.first_name}},

**Last month, a small e-commerce business used our AI to identify a hidden $2M revenue opportunity in their existing data.**

They had the data all along — buried in spreadsheets, analytics tools, and customer records. But they couldn't see the pattern.

Our AI did. In 24 hours.

I'm Joshua Onyekachukwu, founder of **IBIAS** — the platform that's turning this story into reality for thousands of SMBs.

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Most small businesses are data-rich but insight-poor. They collect everything but can't act on anything.

**Our Solution:**
AI that doesn't just analyze data — it tells you exactly what to do next and predicts the impact.

**The Opportunity:**
🎯 $50B market of frustrated business owners  
📈 $12M valuation, raising $1.2M  
🚀 Live prototype proving concept daily  

**What Makes Us Different:**
We focus on **decisions, not dashboards**. Every insight comes with a recommended action and expected outcome.

**The Partnership:**
We're seeking investors who bring more than money:
- Strategic guidance from SaaS veterans
- Access to enterprise customers
- Expertise in scaling AI products

**See It In Action:**
- Live demo: [prototype-link]
- Investment details: [memo attached]
- Quick call: [calendar-link]

Ready to help us turn every SMB into a data-driven powerhouse?

#### **Version E: Detailed (Extended version)**

**Subject:** `Last 2 spots in our $12M pre-Series A (closing fast)`

Hi {{contact.first_name}},

**The SMB data crisis is a $50B opportunity hiding in plain sight.**

Every day, millions of small and medium businesses collect massive amounts of data — sales figures, customer behavior, website analytics, inventory levels — but 87% can't turn this data into smart decisions.

Why? Because data science is expensive, complex, and out of reach.

I'm Joshua Onyekachukwu, founder of **IBIAS**, and we've built the solution.

**What IBIAS Does:**
Our AI platform takes raw business data and transforms it into clear, actionable insights — no technical expertise required. Think of it as having a team of data scientists working 24/7, but at a fraction of the cost.

**Key Differentiators:**
✅ **Decision-focused, not dashboard-focused** — Every insight comes with recommended actions  
✅ **24-hour setup** — From data connection to first insights in under a day  
✅ **ROI-driven** — Our AI predicts the impact of every recommendation  
✅ **Industry-agnostic** — Works for e-commerce, SaaS, retail, services, and more  

**Market Validation:**
- **$50B+ annual losses** due to poor data decisions in SMB market
- **87% of SMBs** struggle to extract value from their data
- **$300K+ annual cost** to hire in-house data science teams
- **Growing demand** for accessible AI solutions

**Current Traction:**
🎯 **Working prototype** generating real business insights  
📊 **Proven concept** with measurable customer outcomes  
🚀 **Strong technical foundation** built by experienced team  
💡 **Clear product-market fit** validated through customer feedback  

**The Investment Opportunity:**
- **Raising:** $1.2M at $12M pre-money valuation
- **Use of funds:** Complete MVP, hire key team members, launch GTM strategy
- **Exit strategy:** Clear path to $120M+ valuation within 3-5 years
- **Market size:** $50B+ addressable market with high growth potential

**Why Strategic Investors:**
We're not just looking for capital. We're building a coalition of investors who bring:
- **Enterprise customer introductions** and warm connections
- **SaaS scaling expertise** from previous successful exits
- **Technical advisory** for AI/ML product development
- **Go-to-market guidance** for B2B SaaS growth

**Competitive Landscape:**
While companies like Tableau and Power BI focus on visualization, and others build complex analytics platforms, IBIAS focuses on **actionable intelligence**. We're the first to combine AI-powered insights with specific business recommendations and impact predictions.

**Team & Execution:**
Our founding team combines deep technical expertise in AI/ML with proven business execution experience. We understand both the technology and the market needs.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Review our investment memo** (attached) for detailed financials, roadmap, and market analysis
2. **Experience our live prototype** at [demo-link] to see the product in action
3. **Schedule a 15-minute call** to discuss strategic fit and partnership opportunities

**Timeline:**
We're moving quickly and expect to close this round within 6 weeks. Given the strategic nature of this raise, we're prioritizing investors who can contribute beyond capital.

If this aligns with your investment thesis and you're interested in helping us transform how SMBs make data-driven decisions, I'd love to start a conversation.
