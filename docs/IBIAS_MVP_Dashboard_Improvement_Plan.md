## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Improvements

#### 1. State Management Enhancement
```typescript
// Enhanced Context Structure
interface DashboardState {
  user: UserProfile
  kpis: KPIMetrics
  insights: AIInsight[]
  alerts: Alert[]
  preferences: UserPreferences
  realTimeData: LiveDataStream
}
```

#### 2. AI Integration Layer
```typescript
// AI Service Architecture
interface AIService {
  generateInsights(data: BusinessData): Promise<AIInsight[]>
  predictTrends(historical: TimeSeriesData): Promise<Prediction[]>
  detectAnomalies(metrics: KPIData): Promise<Anomaly[]>
  recommendActions(context: BusinessContext): Promise<Recommendation[]>
}
```

#### 3. Real-Time Data Pipeline
```typescript
// WebSocket Integration
interface DataStream {
  subscribe(metrics: string[]): void
  unsubscribe(metrics: string[]): void
  onUpdate(callback: (data: MetricUpdate) => void): void
  getLatest(metric: string): Promise<MetricValue>
}
```
